### Pi script
Set the following [code](https://github.com/marcbest/home_automation_scripts/blob/master/pi_to_influx.py) to run via a cron job on the Pi

Followed this [tutorial](https://medium.com/initial-state/how-to-build-a-crawl-space-humidity-monitor-with-a-raspberry-pi-669f2a632cf4) for Pi sensor setup 

### OpenWeatherMap
Set the following [script](https://github.com/marcbest/home_automation_scripts/blob/master/outside_temp_to_influx.py) to run via a cron job somewhere to pull data from the OpenWeatherMap and insert it into Influxdb
